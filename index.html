            HTML is a markup language. It marks parts of the document with structural, presentational, and semantic information alongside content. For example, this is simple document with no markup:
            <div class="Image">
                <img src="sources/FirstImage.png">
            </div>
            Whereas, the same document with markup below. The markup enhances the document by adding meaning to parts of the document:
            <div class="Image">
                <img src="sources/SecondImage.png">
            </div>
            Note that parts of the HTML document are marked with constructs called tags to give better meaning to them. <i><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></i> History <i><b>&lt;/h1&gt;</b></i> means it is a top level heading.
            The h1 tags surrounds the heading. <i><b>&lt;h2&gt;</b></i>Pre-modern<i><b>&lt;/h2&gt;</b></i> means it is a second level heading.
            The word “Ancient China” is Hyper linked to another document. The reader can follow that link to get more information on the topic. <i><b>&lt;img/&gt;</b></i> is used to embed an image in the document.
            This way, an HTML document gives an enhanced experience with hyper links, formatted text with images, video and audio.
            The world wide web is, in fact a collection of several millions of such inter-connected HTML documents hosted on websites.

                <div class="H2">
                    <h2>Why do we need Bootstrap?</h2>
                    <a href="#" class="Back">Back</a>
                </div>
                If we take a look at the website that was created just with HTML, well, it seems to be like this one:
                <div class="Image">
                    <img src="sources/ThirdImage.png">
                </div>
                In order to spruce it up, we’ll add a CSS file to apply styling. Now if you’re not particularly good at CSS, it could take you many days to make this website look pretty.
                Instead of writing your own CSS, you could always use a CSS framework, which is essentially CSS that someone else wrote in a reusable manner.
                One popular CSS framework is Bootstrap, which came out in 2011 and quickly became adopted and used by literally millions of websites.
                Let’s see what the code would look like using Bootstrap:
                <div class="Image">
                    <img src="sources/FourthImage.png">
                </div>
                Not bad! Note that in order to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, you actually don’t need to write any CSS at all to get started
                — you just need to add the appropriate classes to the HTML to take advantage of the CSS that comes with the framework.
                Bootstrap became widely used because it helped with the major pain points of CSS at the time, such as browser inconsistencies and a lack of a proper grid system.
                <br><br>There are some downsides of using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap — in particular, they can be difficult to customize compared to writing CSS from scratch, which can make your website seem generic compared to others.

                JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts.
                They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text.
                They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
                <br><br>
                When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”.
                But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
                <br><br>
                Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
                The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”. Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
                <div class="NumList">
                    <ol>
                        <li>V8 - Chrome and Opera</li>
                        <li>SpiderMonkey - Firefox</li>
                        <li>Chakra and Trident - Internet Explorer</li>
                        <li>SquirrelFish and Nitro - Safari</li>
                        <li>ChakraCore - Microsoft Edge</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
                JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
                JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines fully integration with HTML/CSS, simplicity and support by all major web-browsers.

                Web protocols are some predefined rules that must be followed by everyone communicating over the web. HyperText Transfer Protocol, better known as HTTP, is a web protocol that defines two concepts:
                how client requests are relayed to servers and how servers respond to client requests.
                <br><br>
                But there are some another protocols, that we must know such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
